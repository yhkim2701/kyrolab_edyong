Edge Detection Algorithm in image processing.

Written in matlab (m file), the program takes an image (.jpg, etc format) as an input and
produces an edge bitmap (black and white) as an output.

Unlike other edge detection algorithms already provided in matlab image process library,
this algorithm let the user adjusts level of threshold gradient value for h,s,l (hue, saturation, lightness) values for enhanced contrast effect.
Also it lets to adjust the size of cellular tiling grids used in averaging the gradient of h,s,l values.
